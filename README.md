The purpose of this project is to analyse peoples opinions and their minds during a pandemic. We have gathered relevant data from Twitter, built a model in NLP and then analysed it based on sentiments such as positive or negative.

The value of such a model can be useful for the state officials and companies to effectively promote right practices,change public opinion if its based on fake news, which can be helpful in containing the pandemic
and successfully guide people with correct information.

We have made an End to End pipeline in Databricks, we have first trained the model using PySpark, then we get the live Twitter data using Twitter API, we would then clean it, and apply NLP and BERT models and then predict the sentiment using the trained model.
